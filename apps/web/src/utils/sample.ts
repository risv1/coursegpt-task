        "This module introduces the concepts of concurrency and parallelism in Rust. You'll learn how to create and manage threads, use channels for communication between threads, and protect shared data with mutexes. We'll explore different concurrency patterns and strategies for avoiding data races and deadlocks. Additionally, we'll explore async and await syntax for asynchronous programming. Finally, we'll learn about the Rust standard library's tools for building concurrent applications. Practical examples will demonstrate how to leverage concurrency to improve application performance. The module will cover using threads and channels for safe data sharing.",

          correctAnswer: 0,
          explanation:
            "A data race occurs when multiple threads access the same memory location concurrently, with at least one thread writing, without any synchronization.",
